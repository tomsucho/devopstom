This is a sample web app build just for fun, learning and testing purposes. 
* The App checks vistors IP and provides geo-data related to this address, including location on G maps.
* It is build with Python/Flask/Pandas/Plotly and it is using MongoDB as a data store.
* It is all containerized and ready for k8s deployment, which I test on my bare-metal kubespray based home k8s cluster.
* For CICD/Registry it is using GitLab.
